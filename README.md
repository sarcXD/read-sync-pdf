# Read sync pdf Front-end
Read sync is a project that allows you to read pdf files across any and all devices that you own. The key feature here is that you are able to pickup reading your devices from where you left off.  
My initial intention or thought behind building this was that this could potentially be developed and then perhaps released as a product. While it served me very well for all my reading purposes, it does not work for avid readers since they have dedicated devices (kindle or ipads) for reading and don't have to switch between things.

I had learnt alot building this, especially how to work with pdf.js and building a pdf reader and what not.  

demo: https://readsyncpdf.web.app/
This is the front-end for the project.  
I have not put in work to make this cloning friendly or anything. Contact me if you require assistance, maybe create an issue.  
## Instruction
```
npm install // install dependencies
npm start // start app
```

You need to setup firebase and perhaps your own provider. I don't think you can use the initial and currently hosted product for yourself. Well, unless I have massively messed up.

I honestly don't foresee me working on this soon. There is a lot I can do, but primarily it's that no one uses it, so I can practice and improve my dev skills elsewhere. But a lot can be added and that I am capable of adding, since I have been professionally been working on a pdf app. It's just that right now there is no reason to further develop this.
